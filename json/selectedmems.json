I shared the albums I obsessed over during the holiday with someone I started dating when the school term began. I remember once after school we sat in a park atop a big hill and listened to this song on wired headphones we split, nestled under  our jackets we'd prop up over some sticks for shade. ",

My dad could never get the words right so I'd have to articulate them very clearly while I was signing along and then repeat them to him afterwards. Eventually, when the song came on during our drive, he was able to sing along to all the words.",

The song mirrors my experience entirely, i discovered it during this period and its hard to think that when i saw the comparisons to my life then it felt good.",
