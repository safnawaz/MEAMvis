I shared the albums I obsessed over during the holiday with someone I started dating when the school term began. I remember once after school we sat in a park atop a big hill and listened to this song on wired headphones we split, nestled under  our jackets we'd prop up over some sticks for shade. ",

It was a cloudy morning with a little bit of misting rain. I was sitting in the front passenger seat. I had just broken up with my boyfriend two days prior, and I recall missing him, being very sad to leave all my friends, and fairly anxious/nervous about the logistics of my travel and the upcoming semester.",

    "description": "I remember the song specifically with the memory of being in a music studio and with a band of my friends practicing the song for an upcoming performance for an event by a society in university. I was sitting at the side, listening in and giving feedback as I was the director. I remember feeling emotional trying to envision how great the song would be on stage, and because it was on valentines, I was also overwhelmed with emotion as I was developing feelings for a friend in the band.

I remember that fix you was the last song and it was used in the music video too, which went on to be a massive hit.",

I can do nothing physically while listening to it. I just close my eyes, which try to close the external world and shift to the inner self-spirit. Sometimes tears come out from my eyes accompanied with an implicit emotion. When I listen to it, no one is with me, and I fully enjoy the solitude.",

I remember she showed us this album and also brought us some nazar amulets from her stop in Turkey or Greece. I really love my aunt and whenever she was coming to Romania, it was very exciting because she was always bringing us gifts.",

    "description": "I'm listening to this song in the backseat of a car while my dad is driving. I can't be more than 4 years old. The car is a sedan, with cloth interior seating. My parents are separated, and I am visiting my dad in Spain. I can remember getting in the car, pulling out of the driveway, and hearing this song on the radio. It soon became a favourite of mine. I don't know if this is the first time I had heard the song, but I feel like it was. I don't have any other real memories from this time period.",
